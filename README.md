# What is Descovery?

It is an aggregator for non-fungble tokens. We don not necessarily need a blockchain to make it work. 
However, we need APIs from existing NFT marketplaces. Take a look at: https://www.gem.xyz/ for reference purpose only.

Aim: to build an app/dApp that aggregates all newly (within 3hrs) minted NFTs on five popular NFT marketplaces.
