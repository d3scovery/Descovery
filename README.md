# What is Descovery?

It is an aggregator for non-fungble tokens. We don not necessarily need a blockchain to make it work. 
However, we need APIs from existing NFT marketplaces. Take a look at [gem aggregator](https://www.gem.xyz/) for reference purpose only.

Aim: to build an app/dApp that aggregates all newly (within 3hrs) minted NFTs on five popular NFT marketplaces.

Note:
1. Write clean and understandable codes. Our codes must be understood by both humans and the computer. Comment when necessary. 
2. We write extendable programs. What i mean is, we need not overhaul the entire codebase if need be to add new functionalities.
